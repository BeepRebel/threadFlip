          <ul>
            <li>If the apparel is available on Amazon.in, you can add a new offer by matching it to the existing product or by scanning the product barcode or ISBN through the Seller App.</li>
            <li>If you have a new brand of apparel that is not currently listed on Amazon.in, you will need to create a new listing by uploading product images and filling in the details.</li>
          </ul>
